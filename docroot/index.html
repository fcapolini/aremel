					<strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is shown by default, until the
					collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes
					control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can
					modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting
					that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition
					does limit overflow.
